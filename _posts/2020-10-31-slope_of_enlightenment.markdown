For months now I have been chipping away at my final project for my Flatiron Full Stack Web Development program. I’ve also spent these months caring for my newborn baby daughter. A few diapers here, a few git commits there. 

As I look to finish it up and submit it, I’m realizing just how much of a perfectionist I have become in my programming, partially because I am starting to get to that point in my programming where I am solidly discovering just how much I could be learning and doing. I have just enough tools to start running, but haven’t gone all the way yet. It brings me back to something I learned during my time teaching, the Dunning-Kruger effect.

I’m just starting to move up that “Slope of Enlightenment.” It can be a bit disheartening at times because I am seeing just how much I could do (if given the time), but also trying to stay patient and learn well as I go along the journey.

Today, that means trying to wrap my head around reducers, actions, controlled forms, class components vs. functional components, and React Router Dom. Tomorrow it will be Node.js, deep dives into React Bootstrap, and much more.
