Because you are a sentient human with internet access, I do not need to waste time explaining to you that we are living in a time of great uncertainty.

A cultural revolution is being demanded to fight various systemic injustices on the back of worldwide pandemic caused disorder.

Revolution. Though it seems to demand a new perfection, but quite literally the word points backward, not forward. It comes for the latin “revolver” meaning to roll back. And so, as a programmer, I am looking to do just that. In a time when all available measures point to greater rates of depression, addiction, and general lack of flourishing, I want to be responsible for programming things that roll us back into simpler and slower living.

That is why I have chosen for my final project to create a book list application. In my first 6 years post high school I finished probably 10 books cover to cover (which includes my four years of college). In the subsequent 3 years up to today, I’ve probably read about 10 or so per year and the change has been one of profound peace and joy. It’s far too tempting to spend all our time watching video and taking in visual stimulation with most of our reading coming in the form of captions and other snippets. It can become challenging to read a 7 minute article. And so we have work to do. I hope that this app will help to ease that work just slightly by helping me to:
Keep stock of my current library of books
Categorize my amoebus wish list, a.k.a. “future library”
Give me quick and easy access to the links to move books from future library to my hands
And in the future maybe the ability to share lists and joy with others. Not for the purpose of scrolling and humble-bragging your libraries to your friends, but for the simple purpose of resting and finding peace in an activity that can’t be completed in 7 minutes or binged mindlessly.
